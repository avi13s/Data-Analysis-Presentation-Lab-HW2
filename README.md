Course 094295 HW2 submission

Included are all the needed files. Two important notes:
* predict.py downloads 2 files while running: 
 1) A pickle of our model from our google drive
 2) ResNet50 model for its architecture (we of course used pretrained=False)

* You can find the original Colab notebook from which the report is made here: (the report will contain the link too, as well as to this git repo)
