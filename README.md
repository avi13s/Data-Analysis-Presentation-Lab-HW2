Course 094295 HW2 submission
Maxim 318828761 | Avi 312485816

Included are all the needed files. Two important notes:
* predict.py downloads 2 files while running: 
 1) A pickle of our model from our google drive
 2) ResNet50 model for its architecture (we of course used pretrained=False)

* You can find the original Colab notebook from which the report is made here: (the report will contain the link too, as well as to this git repo)

(That is - if you wish to uncover hidden cells or run some things)

Thanks and enjoy the summer :),

Maxim and Avi
